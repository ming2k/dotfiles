[eq]
# EQ settings adjust the gain for different frequency bands (1.0 = normal, >1.0 = boost, <1.0 = reduce)
# More bands = more precision. Values represent multipliers for each frequency range.

1 = 1.2  # Sub-bass (20-60Hz): kick drums, 808s, bass drops - BOOSTED for impact
2 = 1.2  # Bass (60-170Hz): bass guitar, low vocals, drum fundamentals - enhanced
3 = 1.1  # Low-mids (170-350Hz): vocal warmth, guitar body - neutral
4 = 1.1  # Mids (350-1kHz): vocal clarity, snare, most instruments - neutral  
5 = 1.1  # Upper-mids (1-2kHz): vocal presence, guitar attack - slightly reduced
6 = 0.8  # High-mids (2-4kHz): cymbal attack, vocal sibilance - reduced
7 = 0.8  # Highs (4-6kHz): cymbal shimmer, string brightness - reduced
8 = 0.8  # High-highs (6-8kHz): air, sparkle - reduced to avoid harshness
9 = 0.8  # Very high (8-12kHz): extreme detail, tape hiss - minimal
10 = 0.8 # Ultra high (12kHz+): barely audible harmonics - very minimal
